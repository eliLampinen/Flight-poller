# Flight Price Monitor

This script monitors flight prices from the TUI website and sends email alerts when:

- The price drops for specified flights.
- There are limited seats available ("hurry" alerts).
- The script encounters errors fetching data (once per day).
  
It helps you keep track of flight prices and availability for specific dates and destinations.

## Features

- **Price Monitoring**: Tracks specified flights and alerts when prices drop below a threshold.
- **Limited Seats Alert**: Notifies when flights have limited seats available.
- **Error Notification**: Sends an email if the script fails to fetch data, but only once per day.
- **Future Date Check**: Only runs if there are future flights to monitor.
- **Single Email Alerts**: Consolidates all alerts into one email per script run.
- **Duplicate Alert Prevention**: Prevents sending multiple alerts for the same flight's "hurry" status.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-price-monitor.git
   cd flight-price-monitor
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**

   Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file named `configFile.py` in the project directory. This file contains all the configurable parameters for the script.

### Example `configFile.py`

```python
# configFile.py

# Email configuration
email_sender = 'your_email@gmail.com'
email_password = 'your_email_password'
email_receivers = ["recipient1@example.com", "recipient2@example.com"]

# Flight tracking configuration
dates_to_track = [
    "17-11-2024 路 16:45",
    "10-11-2024 路 17:50"
]  # Dates and times to track (format must match the website's format)

price_threshold = 500  # Maximum price in euros you're willing to pay
destination = 'LPA'     # Destination airport code (default: LPA for Gran Canaria)
duration = 7            # Trip duration in days (default: 7)
airport = 'OUL'         # Departure airport code (default: OUL)
```

### Configuration Parameters

- **Email Settings**
  - `email_sender`: The email address that will send the alerts. (Requires SMTP access)
  - `email_password`: The password or app-specific password for the sender email.
  - `email_receivers`: A list of email addresses to receive the alerts.

- **Flight Tracking Settings**
  - `dates_to_track`: A list of date strings in the format `"dd-mm-yyyy 路 hh:mm"` that you want to monitor.
  - `price_threshold`: The maximum price you're willing to pay for the flights.
  - `destination`: The destination airport code (e.g., `'LPA'` for Gran Canaria).
  - `duration`: The trip duration in days.
  - `airport`: The departure airport code (e.g., `'OUL'`).

### Important Notes

- **Email Security**: Be cautious with storing email credentials. It's recommended to use environment variables or a secure method to handle sensitive information.
- **Date Format**: Ensure that the dates in `dates_to_track` match the format used on the TUI website (`"dd-mm-yyyy 路 hh:mm"`).

## Usage

### Running the Script Manually

You can run the script manually using:

```bash
python flight_price_monitor.py
```

### Script Workflow

1. **Delay**: The script waits for a random duration between 1 and 3 seconds to mimic human behavior.
2. **Future Date Check**: It checks if there are any future dates in `dates_to_track`. If not, the script exits.
3. **Fetch Flight Data**: It attempts to fetch flight data from the TUI website.
   - If it encounters an error (e.g., network issues, non-200 HTTP status), it sends an error email (once per day) and exits.
4. **Parse Flight Data**: Parses the HTML content to extract flight details.
5. **Compare Prices and Alerts**:
   - Checks for price drops and adds to the alerts list if conditions are met.
   - Checks for "hurry" alerts (limited seats) and adds to the alerts list, ensuring no duplicate alerts for the same flight.
6. **Send Email**: If there are any alerts, it sends a single email containing all the alerts.
7. **Data Persistence**: Saves the current flight data to `previous_flights.json` for future comparisons.

## Cron Job Setup

To automate the script to run at regular intervals (e.g., every hour), set up a cron job.

1. **Open the Crontab Editor**

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add the Cron Job**

   Add the following line to schedule the script hourly:

   ```cron
   0 * * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/flight-price-monitor/flight_price_monitor.py
   ```

   - Replace `/usr/bin/python` with the path to your Python interpreter.
   - Replace `/path/to/flight-price-monitor/flight_price_monitor.py` with the actual path to the script.

3. **Save and Exit**

   Save the crontab file and exit the editor.

## Data Files

- **`previous_flights.json`**: Stores flight data between runs to track price changes and "hurry" alerts.
- **`error_log.json`**: Logs the date when the last error email was sent to prevent multiple emails in a single day.

**Note**: Ensure the script has read and write permissions for these files.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No Emails Received**:
  - Check your email configuration in `configFile.py`.
  - Verify that the sender email account allows SMTP access and less secure apps (if applicable).
  - Check spam or junk folders.

- **Script Exits Without Running**:
  - Ensure that `dates_to_track` contains future dates in the correct format.
  - Check the console output for messages like "No future dates to track. Exiting script."

- **Errors Fetching Data**:
  - The script will send an error email if it cannot fetch data.
  - Check your internet connection.
  - Ensure that the TUI website is accessible and hasn't changed its structure.

### Logging

- **Console Output**: The script prints messages to the console, indicating its progress and any issues encountered.
- **Error Emails**: You will receive an email if the script fails to fetch data, but only once per day.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Compliance**: Ensure you comply with the TUI website's terms of service and `robots.txt` rules.
- **Data Usage**: Use the data responsibly and for personal purposes.
- **Request Frequency**: Avoid setting the script to run too frequently to prevent overloading the server.
